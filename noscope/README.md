# This code is for using naive noscope implementation
#### The code has following functionalities:
1. Cascaded of shallow neural networks, with an option to try out different models
2. Customized object detection inference using a tensorflow. The underlying network can be pre-trained as the ones in the tensorflow zoo or you can train one from scratch (more info at https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html)
